                    <p>21 Savage talks about how he has recently stopped wearing jewelery to be a positive influence on the younger generation to show them expensive materialistic things are worth spening on. He said recently that "I want to introduce money management to kids so they have a bright future". 21 also talked about his interest to start investing in houses as it was a better investment saying in an interview to complex that "I see houses as the future area of investment".

Rumors suggest that his new album will be the best to date having multiple features and adapting a new sound of rap.</p>

          <p>Drake talks about how OVO as a brand as grown over the past 5 years. Drake who is still part of Cash Money Records and Universal Music Group said that he feels that his OVO brand has now got into "a confortable place" which he doesn't want it to be in. By this Drake is suggesting that he wants OVO to continuosly grow and not stand still giving his competitors a chance to overtake his brand. We expect OVO to eventually become bigger than brands such as G Unit and Premium Music. </p>
